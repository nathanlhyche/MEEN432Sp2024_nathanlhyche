Here is me and Austins resumbission for Project 1. 
Download the zip file and unzip its contents
For week 1, open file "P1_W1.m" and run it. 
For week 2, open file "P1_W2.m" and run it. 
You can run the different simulations by changing the varibles at the top of the file.
The variable "isSinWave" will change the applied torque from sinusoidal or step input. 
For week 3, there are two files to open which correspond to option 1, and option 2 and 3
For option 1, open file "P1_W3_Opt1.m" and run it.
For options 2 and 3, open file "P1_W3_Opt23.m" and run it.
