ReadME Part 1

1) The first part of part 1 is the P1_part1_racetrack.  It is used to simulate the racetrack coordinates.  the four 
if statements follow the length traveled variable.  ie the first if statement is for distance traveled under 900m and
then after that it is 900 - 1528m and so on for all the other sections.  the way point arrays are used to plot the racetrack 
locations based on the amount of waypoints used. there is also a theta array that has the individual values of the angle
based on its change.
