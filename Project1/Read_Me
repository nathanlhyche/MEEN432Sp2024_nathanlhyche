This is used to operate the Project 1 part 1 code

  You need to open both the p1_code.m and p1_model.slx
  Then run the p1_code.m 
  This should result in 6 different figures appear
    Each figure will have two subplots showing Omega v time and Omega dot v time.
    Each figure will cover one type of solver and time step
      eg. Euler and dT = 0.1 or Runge Katta and dT = 1 etc
  Within the p1_code.m, you can change the b A w_0 and J1 values to simulate the system with different values.
    This works as these variables are entered into the simulink model as teh variables so they will change whenever the p1_code.m is change and ran.
